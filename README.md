# Training AI to play football using Evolutionary Algorithm

- Two teams of 3 player each play a "soccer" game. Both teams controlled by an AI which is trained using evolutionary algorithm.
- Each has a high level and low level controller. High Level controller controls the entire team while the low level controller controls individual player.
- Both the type of controllers are trained using genetic algorithm. The LLC is trained first, where the agent is optimised to approach the target from the correct direction.
- Then the HLC is trained to control 3 player to play a game of football against another team.
